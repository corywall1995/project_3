      <p class = "margin">On the follow page is a checker board with the pieces denoted with either an X or an O. X's (player one) move first.
        To move simple enter the cordinates of the piece you wish to move as an ordered pair separated by a comma, ie. 2,1
        Then press the Select Piece button, doing so will highlight the selected piece on the board,
        if this is not the piece that you intended on moving you may reselect you piece by pressing the reselect button. Once
        you've selected the piece you wish to move then in the next text box enter the coordinates of the spot where you'd
        like to move it to. If you want to jump a piece enter the location of the piece you want to jump, NOT the location of
        where you would end up after the jump.<br>Note: Multiple jumps are not allowed.
